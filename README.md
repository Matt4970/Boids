# Boids
Boid Simlator made with SFML and C++ using Visual Studio. WIP.

I was working on the bird not being able to see behind him so opening up the exe the bird just sits still so I can try and figure out how to do the angle calculations.
The reason this is included in my CS30 projects is because the OOP is on the cleaner end of things I've done at least I believe so.
The next project I work on will likely use C++ and OOP again but it will be a proper game and I intend to make the C++ code even clearner then it currently is by using
things such as inheritance to draw things on to the screen. I've heard that is a way of doing it but since I will only be drawing to the screen
a few things at most in the boid simulator I didn't bother with inheritance. That will be more worthwile for a platformer game or something of the like next.
